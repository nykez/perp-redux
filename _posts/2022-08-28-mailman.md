# PERP needs more legal ways to make money... so I created the mail man!


The job is quite simple: delivery packages. Currently, you become a mailman. Get a truck. Pickup packages. Drop them off at various locationsYou get paid per package.

Later down the road I'd like to implement the mailmail into the real mail / auction house system. I think that would be fun. The delivery truck is currently a UPS skin. I'd like to get a custom one made for evocity (or whatever) *PERP Redux* launches on.
