Like everything else in Redux... the job system was old & outdated. Most of everything was hardcoded - meaning adding new jobs was a time consuming task. Compared to something like DarkRP whre its just a couple lines of code. In PERP it was much harder...

# New Models

It was time for a serious player model upgrade! Not only did I update the default citizen models but every job now has sleek models.


# Different Loadouts

With new models... I thought each job that had a loadout deserved a more modern loadout too. So most jobs now start will sleeker weapon models or entirely different loadouts.


The job system now supports genders too. So picking female for a character would always give you a female job outfit.
